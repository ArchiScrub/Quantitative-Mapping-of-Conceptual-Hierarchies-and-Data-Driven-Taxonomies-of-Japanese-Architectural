[byōbu] (3 exemplars)
  - During the Azuchi–Momoyama period (1568 to 1600) Japan underwent a process of unification after a long period of civil war. It was marked by the rule of Oda Nobunaga and Toyotomi Hideyoshi, men who built castles as symbols of their power; Nobunaga in Azuchi, the seat of his government, and Hideyoshi in Momoyama. The Ōnin War during the Muromachi period had led to rise of castle architecture in Japan. By the time of the Azuchi-Momoyama period each domain was allowed to have one castle of its own. Typically it consisted of a central tower or tenshu (天守; literally heaven defense) surrounded by yards and fortified buildings. All of this was set within massive stone walls and surrounded by deep moats. The dark interiors of castles were often decorated by artists, the spaces were separated up using sliding fusuma panels and byōbu folding screens.
  - The Shoin-zukuri style in the Muromachi period continued to be refined. Verandas linked the interiors of residential buildings with highly cultivated exterior yards. Fusuma and byōbu became highly decorated with paintings and often an interior room with shelving and alcove (tokonoma) were used to display art work (typically a hanging scroll).
  - Museum model of the Saikū, the Saiō's palace. An inner square room with plaster walls contains a chōdai sleeping canopy; a second inner room with kabeshiro wall-curtains contains byōbu folding screens; the far outer wall shows horizontally-hinged shitomi shutters, and the near outer wall has misu blinds. Kichō screens stand on the near side of the hishashi outer corridor, and on the short sides of the same corridor.

[chashitsu] (3 exemplars)
  - The introduction of the tea ceremony emphasised simplicity and modest design as a counterpoint to the excesses of the aristocracy. In the Azuchi–Momoyama period (1568 to 1600), sukiya-zukuri style villas appeared under the influence of a tea house called chashitsu. At first it was an architectural style for the villas of daimyo (Japanese feudal lords) and court nobles, but in the Edo period (1683 to 1807) it was applied to ryōtei (Japanese-style restaurants) and chashitsu, and later it was also applied to residences.
  - In an attempt to rein in the excess of the upper classes, the Zen masters introduced the tea ceremony. In architecture this promoted the design of chashitsu (tea houses) to a modest size with simple detailing and materials. A typically sizee Chashitsu is 4 and half tatami mats in size.
  - During this period, sukiya-zukuri style villas appeared under the influence of a tea house called chashitsu (tea house).

[chigaidana] (3 exemplars)
  - During the Muromachi period, shinden-zukuri style, which was the mainstream of the residences of Japanese nobles, declined, and shoin-zukuri, which developed from buke-zukuri of samurai class residences, became the mainstream. Shoin-zukuri had a lasting impact on later Japanese housing and is the basis of modern Japanese housing. In the old architectural style, tatami mats were laid only in a part of the room, but in the shoin-zukuri style, tatami mats were laid all over the room. In this style, sliding doors called fusuma were used to separate rooms, and an inner window called Shōji, which was made by pasting paper permeable to sunlight on a wooden frame, was installed inside the wooden shutters. In the room, tokonoma (alcove for the display of art objects) and chigaidana (shelves built into the wall) were set up to decorate various things.
  - The architecture surrounding and influenced by the shoin quickly developed many other distinguishing features. Since the guests sat on the floor instead of on furniture, they were positioned at a lower vantage point than their Chinese counterparts who were accustomed to using furniture. This lower vantage point generated such developments as the suspended ceilings which functioned to make the room feel less expansive, and also resulted in the ceilings rafters being no longer visible as they were in China. The new suspended ceilings also allowed for more elaborate decoration, resulting in many highly ornate suspended ceilings in addition to the much simpler ones. Another characteristic development to arise from the lower vantage point were the tokonoma and chigaidana. The tokonoma was an elevated recess built into the wall to create a space for displaying the Chinese art which was popular at the time at a comfortable eye level. The chigaidana, or "staggered shelves", were shelving structures built into the tokonoma to display smaller objects. Occurring at the same time as the development of the shoin architecture, the fusuma, or "sliding doors", were becoming a popular means to divide rooms. As a result, columns began to be created that were square-shaped to accommodate the sliding doors.
  - The asymmetry of the tokonoma and chigaidana pair, as well as the squared pillars differentiated the shoin design with the Chinese design at the time which preferred symmetric pairs of furniture and round pillars. Soon after its advent shoin architecture became associated with these evolving elements as it became the predominant format for formal gathering rooms.

[doma] (3 exemplars)
  - During the 1960s there were also architects who did not see the world of architecture in terms of Metabolism. For example, Kazuo Shinohara specialized in small residential projects in which he explored traditional architecture with simple elements in terms of space, abstraction and symbolism. In the Umbrella House (1961) he explored the spatial relationship between the doma (earth-paved internal floor) and the raised tatami floor in the living room and sleeping room. This relationship was explored further with the House with an Earthen floor (1963) where a tamped-down earthen floor was included in the kitchen area. His use of a roof to anchor his design for the House in White (1966) has been compared with Frank Lloyd Wright's Prairie Houses. Shinohara explored these abstractions as "Three Styles", which were periods of design that stretched from the early sixties to the mid-seventies.
  - Behind the shop space, the remainder of the main building would be divided into the kyoshitsu-bu (居室部, literally 'living room'), composed of divided rooms with raised timber floors and tatami mats coverings. Machiya would also feature a doma (土間) or tōriniwa (通り庭), an unfloored earthen service space that contained the kitchen, also serving as the passage to the rear of the plot, where storehouses known as kura (倉/蔵) would be found.
  - The interior of a minka was generally divided into two sections: a floor of compacted earth, called a doma (土間) (the precursor to a Genkan) and a raised floor (generally around 20 inches (50 centimeters) above the level of the doma), called a hiroma (広間), and, in larger, richer houses, an area or set of rooms covered in tatami or mushiro mats, called a zashiki (座敷). Large farmhouses sometimes had a raised, timber-floored internal veranda (hiroshiki (広敷)) that separated the doma and the tatami areas. In older houses, like the 17th century Yoshimura house, this separating zone was up to 250 centimeters wide and servants apparently slept there.

[en] (3 exemplars)
  - The Kofun period marked the appearance of many-chambered burial mounds or tumuli (kofun literally means "old mounds"). Similar mounds in Korean Peninsula are thought to have been influenced by Japan. Early in the period, the tombs, known as "keyhole kofun" or zenpō-kōen-fun (前方後円墳), often made use of the existing topography, shaping it and adding man-made moats to form a distinctive keyhole shape, in other words that of a circle interconnected with a triangle. Access was via a vertical shaft that was sealed off once the burial was completed. There was room inside the chamber for a coffin and grave goods. The mounds were often decorated with terracotta figures called haniwa. Later in the period mounds began to be located on apartment ground and their scale greatly increased. Among many examples in Nara and  ōsaka, the most notable is the Daisen-kofun, designated as the tomb of Emperor Nintoku. The tomb covers 32 hectares (79 acres) and it is thought to have been decorated with 20,000 haniwa figures.
  - During the Joseon Dynasty, the Korean Zen (Seon) was highly inclusive and ecumenical. This extended to Esoteric Buddhist lore and rituals (that appear in Seon literature from the 15th century onwards). According to Sørensen, the writings of several Seon masters (such as Hyujeong) reveal they were esoteric adepts. In Japanese Zen, the use of esoteric practices within Zen is sometimes termed "mixed Zen" (兼修禪 kenshū zen), and the influential Soto monk Keizan Jōkin (1264 to 1325) was major promoter of esoteric methods. Keizan was heavily influenced by Shingon and Shugendo, and is known for introducing numerous esoteric ritual forms into the Soto school. Another influential Soto figure, Menzan Zuihō (1683 to 1769), was also a practitioner of Shingon, having received esoteric initiation under a Shingon figure named Kisan Biku (義燦比丘). Similarly, numerous Rinzai figures were also esoteric practitioners, such as the Rinzai founder Myōan Eisai (1141 to 1215) and Enni Ben'en (1202 to 1280). Under Enni Ben'en's abbotship, Fumon-in (the future Tōfuku-ji) held Shingon and Tendai rituals. He also lectured on the esoteric Mahavairocana sutra.
  - A new method of tea making, the sencha, was developed. Coined by a tea grower from Uji, Nagatani Sōen (1681 to 1778), it has the particularity of interrupting oxidation by steam before rolling the leaves. These are simply consumed by tossing them into boiling water. This tea and this method of consumption were promoted by the Zen monk Baisaō (1675 to 1763), who cultivated an ideal of frugality since he left his customers free to choose how much they paid for it, and was highly reputed thanks to the tasty quality of his teas, since he emphasizee primarily this aspect of tea consumption, as opposed to the way of the tea ceremony, which insisted on gestures and setting. He destroyed his utensils at the end of his life so that they would not be the object of veneration, but his successor Kimura Kenkadō left a description of them and laid the foundations for the codification of sencha art.

[engawa] (3 exemplars)
  - As the floorboards in a traditional Japanese building are usually raised above the ground, a niwa is an area without the wooden flooring; the floorboards surrounding a yard may form a veranda called an engawa.
  - A shady tsuboniwa with a moss lawn and a chōzu-bachi (手水鉢, literally 'hand water basin'). The engawa on the left is a takesunoko-en, often used in wetter areas, as the bamboo sheds puddles well. There is no engawa on the right.
  - View from tōriniwa over the wood-floored engawa into the row of rooms alongside.

[genkan] (3 exemplars)
  - The largest residential room in a machiya, located in the rear of the main building and looking out over the yard which separated the main house from the storehouse, was known as the zashiki (座敷), and doubled as a reception room for special guests or clients. The sliding doors which made up the walls in a machiya, as in most traditional Japanese buildings, provided a great degree of versatility; doors could be opened and closed or removed entirely to alter the number, size, and shape of rooms to suit the needs of the moment. Typically, however, the remainder of the building might be arranged to create smaller rooms, including an entrance hall or foyer (genkan (玄関)), butsuma (仏間), naka no ma (中の間) and oku no ma (奥の間), both of which mean simply 'central room'.
  - The interior of a minka was generally divided into two sections: a floor of compacted earth, called a doma (土間) (the precursor to a Genkan) and a raised floor (generally around 20 inches (50 centimeters) above the level of the doma), called a hiroma (広間), and, in larger, richer houses, an area or set of rooms covered in tatami or mushiro mats, called a zashiki (座敷). Large farmhouses sometimes had a raised, timber-floored internal veranda (hiroshiki (広敷)) that separated the doma and the tatami areas. In older houses, like the 17th century Yoshimura house, this separating zone was up to 250 centimeters wide and servants apparently slept there.
  - The main reception room is characterizee by specific features: a recessed alcove (tokonoma), staggered shelves, built-in desks, and ornate sliding doors. Generally the reception room is covered with wall-to-wall tatami and has square beveled pillars, a coved or coffered ceiling, and wooden shutters to protect the area from rain (雨戸, amado). The entrance hall (genkan) emerged as an element of residential architecture during the Momoyama period. The oldest extant shoin style building is the Tōgu-dō at Ginkaku-ji dating from 1485. Other representative examples of early shoin style, also called shuden, include two guest halls at Mii-dera. In the early Edo period, shoin-zukuri reached its peak and spread beyond the residences of the military elite. The more formal shoin-style of this period is apparent in the characteristics of Ninomaru Palace at Nijō Castle as well as the shoin at Nishi Hongan-ji.

[haiden] (3 exemplars)
  - The Ujigami Shrine (宇治上神社, Ujigami-jinja) is a Shinto shrine in the city of Uji, Kyōto Prefecture, Japan. The shrine was built as a guardian shrine for the nearby Byōdō-in, and is adjacent to the Uji Shrine. In 1994, it was registered as a UNESCO World Heritage Site as one of the "Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyōto". The honden and haiden have been designated by the Agency for Cultural Affairs as National Treasures in the category shrines.
  - The honden of the Ujigami Shrine is known as the oldest example of nagare-zukuri style of shrine architecture in Japan. In this style of architecture the three inner shrine structures are built side-by-side, with the structure in the middle being larger than those to the left and right. The honden dates to the late Heian period (794 to 1185). The haiden is built in the shinden-zukuri style, and its roof in the sugaruhafu style. The haiden dates to the Kamakura period (1185 to 1333). The Kasuga Shrine, also within the shrine precinct, dates to the same period. The shrine is noted for its freshwater spring.
  - A shrine may include within its grounds several structures, each destined to a different purpose. Among them are the honden or sanctuary, where the kami are enshrined, the heiden, or hall of offerings, where offers and prayers are presented, and the haiden or hall of worship, where there may be seats for worshipers. The honden is the building that contains the shintai, literally, "the sacred body of the kami". Of these, only the haiden is open to the laity. The honden is located behind the haiden and is usually much smaller and unadorned. Other notable shrine features are the temizuya, the fountain where visitors cleanse their hands and mouth and the shamusho (社務所), the office that supervises the shrine. Shrines can be very large, as for example Ise Shrine, or as small as a beehive, as in the case of the hokora, small shrines frequently found on road sides.

[hisashi] (3 exemplars)
  - Sometimes its basic layout, consisting of an elevated core (母屋, moya) partially surrounded by a veranda called hisashi (all under the same roof), is modified by the addition of a room in front of the entrance. A nagare-zukuri honden (sanctuary) varies in roof ridge length from 1 to 11 ken, but is never 6 or 8 ken. The most common sizes are 1 and 3 ken. The oldest shrine in Japan, Uji's Ujigami Shrine, has a honden of this type. Its external dimensions are 5 by 3 ken, but internally it is composed of three sanctuaries (内殿, naiden) measuring 1 ken each.
  - The core of a traditional Shinden-style building was the innermost room or moya (母屋). This was surrounded by the hisashi (廂,庇), which was on the same level, and was usually inside the windows and shitomi storm shutters. The hisashi was often a ring of tatami-floored rooms, but could be an unmatted en. In a large building, there could be further layers of tatami-floored rooms, courtyards, and further floorplan complications.
  - Moya and hisashi. The hisashi may itself be an en in small buildings, or it may be a second layer of tatami-floored rooms, with a hard-floored en running outside it

[ikezuishi] (3 exemplars)
  - ikezuishi, malicious stones or thoughtful simplicity?
  - “ikezuishi” is composed of two words, “ikezu”, meaning “malicious” in Kyōto dialects, and “ishi” meaning rock in standard Japanese. Therefore we can begin by stating that these rocks purpose are actually malicious (particularly city cab drivers may agree).
  - So next time you are planning your trip to Kyōto for a long term stay or a short term stay as well, make sure to contact our experienced multilingual staff to help you find your home in Kyōto, and don’t forget to look down while turning a corner to not trip on an ikezuishi.

[karesansui] (3 exemplars)
  - In the yard, Zen principles replaced water with sand or gravel to produce the dry yard (karesansui) like the one at Ryōan-ji.
  - •	Karesansui of Ryōan-ji
  - •	Karesansui of Daisen-in

[roji] (3 exemplars)
  - A 4.5-mat room is considered standard, but smaller and larger rooms are also used. Building materials and decorations are deliberately simple and rustic in wabi style tea rooms. Chashitsu can also refer to free-standing buildings for tea. Known in English as tea houses, such structures may contain several tea rooms of different sizes and styles, dressing and waiting rooms, and other amenities, and be surrounded by a tea yard called a roji.
  - The guests are served a cup of the hot water, kombu tea, roasted barley tea, or sakurayu. When all the guests have arrived and finished their preparations, they proceed to the outdoor waiting bench in the roji, where they remain until summoned by the host.
  - Following a silent bow between host and guests, the guests proceed in order to a tsukubai (stone basin) where they ritually purify themselves by washing their hands and rinsing their mouths with water, and then continue along the roji to the tea house. They remove their footwear and enter the tea room through a small "crawling-in" door (nijiri-guchi), and proceed to view the items placed in the tokonoma and any tea equipment placed ready in the room, and are then seated seiza-style on the tatami in order of prestige.

  - Torii and omote-sandō at Usa Jingū.

[shimenawa] (3 exemplars)
  - Japanese yards have their roots in the national religion of Shinto, with its story of the creation of eight perfect islands, and of the shinchi, the lakes of the gods. Prehistoric Shinto shrines to the kami, the gods and spirits, are found on beaches and in forests all over the island. They often took the form of unusual rocks or trees marked with cords of rice fiber (shimenawa) and surrounded with white stones or pebbles, a symbol of purity. The white gravel courtyard became a distinctive feature of Shinto shrines, Imperial Palaces, Buddhist temples, and Zen yards. Although its original meaning is somewhat obscure, one of the Japanese words for yard—niwa—came to mean a place that had been cleansed and purified in anticipation of the arrival of kami, and the Shinto reverence for great rocks, lakes, ancient trees, and other "dignitaries of nature" would exert an enduring influence on Japanese yard design.
  - A yorishiro (依り代/依代/憑り代/憑代) in Shinto terminology is an object capable of attracting spirits called kami, thus giving them a physical space to occupy during religious ceremonies. Yorishiro are used during ceremonies to call the kami for worship. The word itself literally means "approach substitute". Once a yorishiro actually houses a kami, it is called a shintai. Ropes called shimenawa decorated with paper streamers called shide often surround yorishiro to make their sacredness manifest. Persons can play the same role as a yorishiro, and in that case are called yorimashi (憑坐, literally 'possessed person') or kamigakari (神懸り/神憑, literally 'kami possession').
  - Part of the reading disparity may have been due to the confusion between similar characters 社 and 杜. Many shrines still have on their grounds one of the original great yorishiro, a great tree surrounded by a sacred rope called shimenawa (標縄/注連縄/七五三縄). Now such trees have become divine by association, and no longer simply represent a kami.

[shōji] (3 exemplars)
  - As the samurai class gained power in the Kamakura period (1185 to 1333), the shinden-zukuri style changed, and in the Muromachi period (1333 to 1573), the shoin-zukuri style appeared. This style had a lasting influence on later Japanese architectural styles and became the basis of modern Japanese houses. Its characteristics were that sliding doors called fusuma and paper windows called shōji were fully adopted, and tatami mats were laid all over the room.
  - During the Muromachi period, shinden-zukuri style, which was the mainstream of the residences of Japanese nobles, declined, and shoin-zukuri, which developed from buke-zukuri of samurai class residences, became the mainstream. Shoin-zukuri had a lasting impact on later Japanese housing and is the basis of modern Japanese housing. In the old architectural style, tatami mats were laid only in a part of the room, but in the shoin-zukuri style, tatami mats were laid all over the room. In this style, sliding doors called fusuma were used to separate rooms, and an inner window called Shōji, which was made by pasting paper permeable to sunlight on a wooden frame, was installed inside the wooden shutters. In the room, tokonoma (alcove for the display of art objects) and chigaidana (shelves built into the wall) were set up to decorate various things.
  - Interiors are very simple, highlighting minimal and natural decoration. Traditional Japanese interiors, as well as modern, incorporate mainly natural materials including fine woods, bamboo, silk, rice straw mats, and paper shōji screens. Natural materials are used to keep simplicity in the space that connects to nature. Natural color schemes are used and neutral palettes including black, white, off-white, gray, and brown.

Fusuma and byōbu became highly decorated with paintings and often an interior room with shelving and alcove (tokonoma) were used to display art work (typically a hanging scroll).
  - A recessed space called tokonoma is often present in traditional as well as modern Japanese living rooms. This is the focus of the room and displays Japanese art, usually a painting or calligraphy.

[tomeishi] (3 exemplars)
  - tomeishi
  - Dear Miranda, You were duly diverted by a tomeishi (stop stone) or, to use its more descriptive name, a sekimori ishi (boundary-guard stone). It is a device used in Japanese yards, particularly those with tea houses, to guide visitors along a prescribed route. You occasionally see them elsewhere, such as outside a traditional restaurant to indicate it's closed, but these whimsical wrong-way markers are most strongly associated with tea yards.
  - Tomeishi: The Stopping Stone

[torii] (3 exemplars)
  - Zen Buddhism was a primary influence in the development of the culture of Japanese tea. Shinto has also greatly influenced the Japanese tea ceremony. For example, the practice of purifying one's hands and mouth before practicing the tea ceremony is influenced by the Shinto purification ritual of misogi. The architectural style of the chashitsu and the gate that serves as the boundary between the tea yard and the secular world have been influenced by Shinto shrine architecture and the torii (shrine gate).
  - •	sandō （参道）- the approach leading from a torii to a shrine. The term is also used sometimes at Buddhist temples too.
  - •	torii (鳥居)- the iconic Shinto gate at the entrance of a sacred area, usually, but not always, a shrine. Shrines of various size can be found next to, or inside temples.

[tsuboniwa] (3 exemplars)
  - Japanese literature on yarding goes back almost a thousand years, and several different styles of yard have developed, some with religious or philosophical implications. A characteristic of Japanese yards is that they are designed to be seen from specific points. Some of the most significant different traditional styles of Japanese yard are the chisen-shoyū-teien ("lake-spring-boat excursion yard"), which was imported from China during the Heian period (794 to 1185). These were designed to be seen from small boats on the central lake. No original examples of these survive, but they were replaced by the "paradise yard" associated with Pure Land Buddhism, with a Buddha shrine on an island in the lake. Later large yards are often in the kaiyū-shiki-teien, or promenade yard style, designed to be seen from a path circulating around the yard, with fixed stopping points for viewing. Specializee styles, often small sections in a larger yard, include the moss yard, the dry yard with gravel and rocks, associated with Zen Buddhism, the roji or teahouse yard, designed to be seen only from a short pathway, and the tsuboniwa, a very small urban yard.
  - Most modern Japanese homes have little space for a yard, though the tsuboniwa style of tiny yards in passages and other spaces, as well as bonsai (in Japan always grown outside) and houseplants mitigates this, and domestic yard tourism is very important. The Japanese tradition has long been to keep a well-designed yard as near as possible to its original condition, and many famous yards appear to have changed little over several centuries, apart from the inevitable turnover of plants, in a way that is extremely rare in the West.
  - Small yards were originally found in the interior courtyards (naka-niwa, "inner yard") of Heian period palaces, and were designed to give a glimpse of nature and some privacy to the residents of the rear side of the building. They were as small as one tsubo, or about 330 square centimeters, whence the name tsuboniwa. During the Edo period, merchants began building small yards in the space behind their shops, which faced the street, and their residences, located at the rear. These tiny yards were meant to be seen, not entered, and usually had a stone lantern, a water basin, stepping stones and a few plants. Today, tsuboniwa are found in many Japanese residences, hotels, restaurants, and barlic buildings. A good example from the Meiji period is found in the villa of Murin-an in Kyōto. Totekiko is a famous courtyard rock yard.

[aware] (3 exemplars)
  - Alberto Campo Baeza is a Spanish architect and describes his work as essential architecture. He values the concepts of light, idea, and space. Light is essential and achieves the relationship between inhabitants and the building. Ideas are to meet the function and context of space, forms, and construction. Space is shaped by the minimal geometric forms to avoid decoration that is not essential. While both minimalist and contemporary minimalism stress simplicity, there are some significant differences. Minimalism emphasizes only the essentials and employs simple, large-sizee components in less amounts. Modern minimalism, on the other hand, uses more decorative pieces. While modern minimalism includes eye-catching forms, minimalist designs tend to emphasize geometric shapes and straight lines. Another difference is space; modern minimalism permits trendy items, while minimalist environments are open and empty. While modern minimalism incorporates colorful, seductive elements that accentuate the modern aesthetic while keeping a neutral color scheme, minimalist furniture is necessary and practical. Although simplicity is emphasizee in both forms, modern minimalism adds trends and gives places a more lively vibe. It is easier to differentiate between the two types when one is aware of these distinctions.
  - •	The work of American artist John Connell (1940 to 2009) is also considered to be centered on wabi_sabi. Other artists influenced by the idea include former Stuckist and remodernist moviemaker Jesse Richards (born 1975), who incorporates wabi_sabi and mono no aware into much of his work.
  - Hongzhi's practice of silent illumination does not depend on concentration on particular objects, "such as visual images, sounds, breathing, concepts, stories, or deities." Instead, it is a non-dual "objectless" meditation, involving "withdrawal from exclusive focus on a particular sensory or mental object." This practice allows the meditator to be aware of "all phenomena as a unified totality," without any conceptualizing, grasping, goal seeking, or subject-object duality. According to Leighton, this method "rests on the faith, verified in experience, that the field of vast brightness is ours from the outset." This "vast luminous buddha field" is our immanent "inalienable endowment of wisdom" which cannot be cultivated or enhanced. Instead, one just has to recognize this radiant clarity without any interference.

[fusuma] (3 exemplars)
  - Japanese architecture (日本建築, Nihon kenchiku) has been typified by wooden structures, elevated slightly off the ground, with tiled or thatched roofs. Sliding doors (fusuma) and other traditional partitions were used in place of walls, allowing the internal configuration of a space to be customizee for different occasions. People usually sat on cushions or otherwise on the floor, traditionally; chairs and high tables were not widely used until the 20th century. Since the 19th century, however, Japan has incorporated much of Western, modern, and mail-modern architecture into construction and design, and is today a leader in cutting-edge architectural design and technology.
  - As the samurai class gained power in the Kamakura period (1185 to 1333), the shinden-zukuri style changed, and in the Muromachi period (1333 to 1573), the shoin-zukuri style appeared. This style had a lasting influence on later Japanese architectural styles and became the basis of modern Japanese houses. Its characteristics were that sliding doors called fusuma and paper windows called shōji were fully adopted, and tatami mats were laid all over the room.
  - During the Muromachi period, shinden-zukuri style, which was the mainstream of the residences of Japanese nobles, declined, and shoin-zukuri, which developed from buke-zukuri of samurai class residences, became the mainstream. Shoin-zukuri had a lasting impact on later Japanese housing and is the basis of modern Japanese housing. In the old architectural style, tatami mats were laid only in a part of the room, but in the shoin-zukuri style, tatami mats were laid all over the room. In this style, sliding doors called fusuma were used to separate rooms, and an inner window called Shōji, which was made by pasting paper permeable to sunlight on a wooden frame, was installed inside the wooden shutters. In the room, tokonoma (alcove for the display of art objects) and chigaidana (shelves built into the wall) were set up to decorate various things.

  - The Art Deco interior designer Paul Follot defended Art Deco in this way: "We know that man is never content with the indispensable and that the superfluous is always needed...If not, we would have to get rid of music, flowers, and perfumes..!" However, Le Corbusier was a brilliant barlicist for modernist architecture; he stated that a house was simply "a machine to live in", and tirelessly promoted the idea that Art Deco was the past and modernism was the future. Le Corbusier's ideas were gradually adopted by architecture schools, and the aesthetics of Art Deco were abandoned. The same features that made Art Deco popular in the beginning, its craftsmanship, rich materials and ornament, led to its decline. The Great Depression that began in the United States in 1929, and reached Europe shortly afterwards, greatly reduced the number of wealthy clients who could pay for the furnishings and art objects. In the Depression economic climate, few companies were ready to build new skyscrapers. Even the Ruhlmann firm resorted to producing pieces of furniture in series, rather than individual hand-made items. The last buildings built in Paris in the new style were the Museum of Barlic Works by Auguste Perret (now the French Economic, Social and Environmental Council), the Palais de Chaillot by Louis-Hippolyte Boileau, Jacques Carlu and Léon Azéma, and the Palais de Tōkyō of the 1937 Paris International Exposition; they looked out at the grandiose pavilion of Nazi Germany, designed by Albert Speer, which faced the equally grandiose socialist-realist pavilion of Stalin's Soviet Union.
  - The Japanese aesthetic principle of Ma refers to empty or open space. It removes all the unnecessary internal walls and opens up the space. The emptiness of spatial arrangement reduces everything down to the most essential quality.

[mu] (3 exemplars)
  - Zen masters and texts took great pains to avoid the reification of doctrinal concepts and terms, including important terms like buddha-nature and enlightenment. This is because Zen affirms the Mahayana view of emptiness, which states that all phenomena lack a fixed and independent essence (svabhava). To avoid any reification which grasps at essences, Zen sources often make use of a negative dialectic influenced by Madhyamaka philosophy. As Kasulis writes, since all things are empty, "the Zen student must learn not to think of linguistic distinctions as always referring to ontically distinct realities." Indeed, all doctrines, distinctions and words are relative and deceptive in some way, and thus they must be transcended. This apophatic element of Zen teaching is sometimes described as Mu (無, Chinese: wú, "no"), which appears in the famous Zhaozhou's Dog koan: A monk asked, "Does a dog have a Buddha-nature or not?"; The master said, "Not [wú]!".
  - Zen emphasizes zazen, meditation or dhyana in a sitting position. In Soto, the emphasis is on shikantaza, 'just sitting', while Rinzai also uses koans to train the mind. In alternation with zazen, there is walking meditation, kinhin, in which one walks with full attention. To facilitate insight, a Zen teacher can assign a kōan. This is a short anecdote, which seems irrational, but contains subtle references to the Buddhist teachings. An example of a kōan is Joshu's 'Mu':
  - A monk asked: "Does a dog have buddha-nature?" Joshu responded: "Mu!"

  - Ryōan-ji dry yard. The clay wall, which is stained by age with subtle brown and orange tones, reflects "wabi" and the rock yard "sabi", together reflecting the Japanese worldview or aesthetic of "wabi_sabi".
  - wabi_sabi combines two interrelated concepts: wabi (侘) and sabi (寂). According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, wabi may be translated as "subdued, austere beauty", and sabi as "rustic patina". wabi_sabi derives from the Buddhist teaching of the three marks of existence (三法印, sanbōin), which include impermanence (無常, mujō), suffering (苦, ku), and emptiness or absence of self-nature (空, kū).
  - When considering an English translation of the words wabi and sabi, Juniper explains that "they have been used to express a vast range of ideas and emotions, and so their meanings are more open to personal interpretation than almost any other word in the Japanese vocabulary." As a result, attempts to translate wabi_sabi directly may obscure the ambiguity essential to its meaning.

[shakkei] (3 exemplars)
  - The Golden Pavilion is set in a Japanese strolling yard (回遊式庭園, kaiyū-shiki-teien; literally a landscape yard in the go-round style). The location implements the idea of borrowing of scenery ("shakkei") that integrates the outside and the inside, creating an extension of the views surrounding the pavilion and connecting it with the outside world. The pavilion extends over a pond, called Kyōko-chi (鏡湖池, Mirror Pond), that reflects the building. The pond contains 10 smaller islands. The zen typology is seen through the rock composition; the bridges and plants are arranged in a specific way to represent famous places in Chinese and Japanese literature. Vantage points and focal points were established because of the strategic placement of the pavilion to view the yards surrounding the pavilion. A small fishing hall (釣殿, tsuri-dono) or roofed deck is attached to the rear of the pavilion building, allowing a small boat to be moored under it. The pavilion grounds were built according to descriptions of the Western Paradise of the Buddha Amida, intending to illustrate a harmony between heaven and earth. The largest islet in the pond represents the Japanese islands. The four stones forming a straight line in the pond near the pavilion are intended to represent sailboats anchored at night, bound for the Isle of Eternal Life in Chinese mythology.
  - Most of the yards of the Edo period were either promenade yards or dry rock Zen yards, and they were usually much larger than earlier yards. The promenade yards of the period made extensive use of borrowed scenery (shakkei). Vistas of distant mountains are integrated in the design of the yard; or, even better, building the yard on the side of a mountain and using the different elevations to attain views over landscapes outside the yard. Edo promenade yards were often composed of a series of meisho, or "famous views", similar to mailcards. These could be imitations of famous natural landscapes, like Mount Fuji, or scenes from Taoist or Buddhist legends, or landscapes illustrating verses of poetry. Unlike Zen yards, they were designed to portray nature as it appeared, not the internal rules of nature.
  - •	Borrowed scenery (shakkei): Smaller yards are often designed to incorporate borrowed scenery, the view of features outside the yard such as hills, trees or temples, as part of the view. This makes the yard seem larger than it really is.

  - Ryōan-ji dry yard. The clay wall, which is stained by age with subtle brown and orange tones, reflects "wabi" and the rock yard "sabi", together reflecting the Japanese worldview or aesthetic of "wabi_sabi".
  - The Japanese aesthetic of wabi_sabi values the quality of simple and plain objects. It appreciates the absence of unnecessary features, treasures a life in quietness, and aims to reveal the innate character of materials. For example, the Japanese floral art of ikebana has the central principle of letting the flower express itself. People cut off the branches, leaves, and blossoms from the plants and only retain the essential part of the plant. This conveys the idea of essential quality and innate character in nature.
  - Japanese interior design has a unique aesthetic derived from Shinto, Taoism, Zen Buddhism, world view of wabi_sabi, specific religious figures and the West. This aesthetic has in turn influenced Western style, particularly Modernism.
